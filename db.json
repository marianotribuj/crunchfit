    "overview":"The standing Zottman curl is a variation of the standing dumbbell curl and an exercise used to strengthen the muscles of the biceps.  The Zottman curl utilizes different hand positioning at different portions of the lift to capitalize on the strength of the lifter and maximize arm growth. The first portion, the regular curl, allows the lifter to focus on their bicep strength. The lowering portion, after already using a heavier weight than one would typically use in a dumbbell reverse curl, allows you to overload the forearms.  Bicep isolation work is particularly helpful for those looking to achieve aesthetics and building a balanced physique.",
